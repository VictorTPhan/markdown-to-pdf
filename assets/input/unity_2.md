# Unity 2 Course Syllabus

## Objectives
This course will take a deeper look into programming games using the Unity Game engine. Students will learn how to manipulate various game components using Unity in conjunction with code written in C#. In this course, students will create a variety of video game projects that will reinforce best programming practices and the game development cycle.
