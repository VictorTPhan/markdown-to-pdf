# AI 2 Course Syllabus

## Objectives

This course aims at expanding on concepts taught in AI 1 as well as diving into specific implementations of AI models. We focus mainly on image classification algorithms and natural language processing in this course. We break down the major topics into "Modules" that focus on each topic one at a time.

## Module Topics

1. Crash Course - A primer on Python before we jump into AI.
2. Natural Language Processing - A deep dive into how programs can determine the topics and semantics of words within given texts.
3. Image Classification - Experiments and tutorials on how to make your own image classification algorithm as well as ways to expand on it.
4. OpenCV2 - A primer on how to manipulate images and videos using the OpenCV2 library for Python.
5. Pose Estimation - a guide on how to detect certain poses from images and videos using the MediaPipe library.
