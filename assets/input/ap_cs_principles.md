# AP Computer Science Principles Tutoring Syllabus

AP Computer Science Tutoring is a class where students will prepare for the AP CS P exam and the associated Create Task, with a smaller focus on improving existing grades in an AP CS P class they are concurrently taking in high school.

This course utilizes the AP Computer Science Principles Premium 2024 test preparation book, written by Seth Reichelson under the Barron's AP Prep collection. The Barron's line of AP test prep books has been a staple among students for their reliability and quality.

The book contains a diagnostic exam, 6 practice tests, a wealth of information, as well as a guide on the Create Task. Instructors will guide students along the book as well as giving them additional information and guidance with regards to improving on weak points.

We use a diagnostic-test styled form of training for this curriculum by having students take assessments before we dive deeper, in order to best determine their weak points and to ensure the most exposure as possible to the AP test material.

We break down the class structure as follows:

| Name                    | Description                                                                           |
