# Java 1 Course Syllabus

## Objectives
This course provides a basic overview of Java and programming principles, using various practical application examples to see results of what Java is capable of. These skills are also the building blocks used across all programming languages, so the concepts students learn in this course can be applied universally. We break down the major topics into "Modules" that focus on each topic one at a time.

## Module Topics

1. Programming Basics - Understanding of basic printing, primitive data types, variables, and user input
2. Conditionals - Understanding boolean operators and how to construct complex conditional statements using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.
3. Loops - Create programs that can perform actions until conditions are met, or repeat actions concretely
4. Methods - Define reusable code that can be applied throughout your program or used in your own code libraries
5. Data Structures - Understand how and why programmers use specific formatted collections of data to architect programs
6. Projects - Several challenging projects to test mastery of Java
