# Java 3 / AP Computer Science A Tutoring Syllabus

Java 3 is a class where students will prepare for the AP CS A exam. AP Computer Science A Tutoring is an extension of Java 3 with a smaller focus on improving existing grades in an AP CS A class they are concurrently taking in high school.

This course utilizes the AP Computer Science A 7th Edition test preparation book, written by Roselyn Teukolsky under the Barron's AP Prep collection. The Barron's line of AP test prep books has been a staple among students for their reliability and quality.

The book contains a diagnostic exam, 4 practice tests, and lengthy explanations on Java concepts. Instructors will guide students along the book as well as giving them additional information and guidance with regards to improving on weak points.

We use a diagnostic-test styled form of training for this curriculum by having students take assessments before we dive deeper, in order to best determine their weak points and to ensure the most exposure as possible to the AP test material.

We break down the class structure as follows:
