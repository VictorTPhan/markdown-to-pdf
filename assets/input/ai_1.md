# AI 1 Course Syllabus

## Objectives

This course aims at introducing the basic concepts about AI and machine learning. We focus on using the `scikit-learn` library to build applications as well as digging into the theories. We break down the major topics into "Modules" that focus on each topic one at a time.

## Module Topics

1. Crash Course - A primer on Python before we jump into AI.
2. Introduction to AI - A conceptual discussion on what AI is, where it is used, and the basics on how most AI models function.
3. Regression Models - A discussion and implementation on linear and polynomial regression models and when to use regression models.
4. Classification - A discussion and implementation of classification models and when to use them over regression models.
5. Rock Paper Scissors Project - A project implementing both regression and classification models to make a rock paper scissors AI.
6. Clustering - A discussion and implementation of clustering models and when to use them over regression and classification models.
7. Sentiment Analysis - A discussion and implementation of what sentiment analysis is and a brief introduction to webscraping as a demonstration.
8. Web Deployment - A small foray into the world of web design as we deploy our AI projects to the Internet.
9. Mobile Deployment - A small foray into the world of app design as we deploy our AI onto a mobile application.
10. Cutting Edge AI - A preview into advanced AI as we play with new libraries in Google Colab.
