# Python 2 Course Syllabus

## Objectives

This course provides students with the intermediate knowledge needed to create better  Python applications. Many concepts taught in this course have analogous concepts in other programming languages as well. We break down the major topics into "Modules" that focus on each topic one at a time.

## Module Topics

1. Functions Design - Learn how pseudocode works, why we use pseudocode, how to architect a program and how to refactor a program
2. Lists - Learn data structures, how indexing works, why we use lists, and how to use loops in lists
3. Strings - Learn more about a commmon data type and how to manipulate strings
4. Dictionaries - Learn advanced data structures, how key-value pairs work, why we use dictionaries, and how to represent the world using data structures
