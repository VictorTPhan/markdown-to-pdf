# Python 1 Course Syllabus

## Objectives
This course provides students with the fundamental programming skills needed to create their own Python applications. These skills are also the building blocks used across all programming languages, so the concepts students learn in this course can be applied universally. We break down the major topics into "Modules" that focus on each topic one at a time.

## Module Topics

1. Programming Basics - Store and manipulate fundamental data types, generate random data, output information to program users, and build text interfaces to handle user input
2. If Conditionals - Control the decisions and actions of a program through data comparisons
3. While loops - Create programs that can perform actions indefinitely or until specific conditions are met
4. For loops - Improve program and coding efficiency by simplifying actions with repetition
5. Function Basics - Define reusable code that can be applied throughout your program or used in your own code libraries
